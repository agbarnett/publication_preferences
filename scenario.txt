Imagine you have written a paper and are now trying to get it published in a journal.

Your paper contains original research and is around 4,000 words long with tables and figures. Your paper is relevant in your field and you believe it is good quality.

You will only consider journals that fit the scope of your paper and that your target audience read. You have no previous experience with the hypothetical journals (good or bad). You do not have any personal or professional relationships with the hypothetical journal editors or publishers.

You are the first author and will make all decisions on behalf of your co-authors.

Your paper has not yet been submitted to any journal.
